Predicting Sea Kelp Coverage Based on Environmental Variables

Hypothesis: Rising sea surface temperatures and current velocities, along with decreasing water pH levels  will lead to a significant reduction in kelp coverage in the future decades.

Analysis Plan:
1. Create a line plot demonstrating the trends of sea surface temperature (SST), current velocity (CUV), and water pH from 2000 to 2060 under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs: SSP1-1.9, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5).
2. Develop a plot illustrating the predicted kelp coverage in the Tasmania region for the decades of 2020 and 2050 under the different SSP scenarios.
3. Generate a map plot showing the actual kelp coverage data points from 2000 to 2010 in Tasmania for spatial context.
4. Create a scatter plot with a trendline to demonstrate the correlation between the environmental variables (SST, CUV, pH) and kelp coverage.
5. Produce a comparative analysis of the model's predicted kelp coverage versus actual coverage to highlight discrepancies and biases in predictions.
